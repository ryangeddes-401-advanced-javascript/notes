/* 
  Write a function called isEven that receives 2 parameters:
    A Number
    A Callback function

  Determine if the number is even. If so, invoke the callback with true as an argument, otherwise, false

  -----

  Create an array of numbers.

  Iterate the array with a for loop, each time calling the isEven function with the number and a callback
  
  The callback should console.log() the return value from isEven()

*/




/* 
  Write a function called contents that receives 1 parameter:
    A File Name

  Using the fs module, open and read the contents of the file,converting them to text and printing the content to the console.

  Print a console.error() if anything goes wrong.

  You can test this by calling your function with './words.txt', which is a file that exists, and then again with the name of a file that does not exist.
